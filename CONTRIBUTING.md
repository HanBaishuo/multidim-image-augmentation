# How to Contribute

We are not actively soliciting github pull requests at this time, but we
warmly welcome you to create a [github
issue](https://github.com/deepmind/multidim-image-augmentation/issues/new)
for any bugs or feature requests you may have. In order to contribute design
ideas or code (via the issue tracker or otherwise) to this project you will need
to complete the Contributor License Agreement as described below.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

This github project is a mirror of our internal master copy of the source. As
such all changes must first be submitted internally, where we conduct code
reviews and continuous integration testing, before publishing externally. In
future we may open up submissions via the github pull request process.
